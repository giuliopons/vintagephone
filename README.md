## FOLDERS

On your local Arduino libraries folder create a folder `vintagephone` and put all the files of this repository.

The files in the `mp3-files` folder are the files that must be moved to the micro-sd card for the DFplayer mini.

The files in `data` folders are transfered by Arduino IDE to Wemos when you upload the SPIFFS files.
